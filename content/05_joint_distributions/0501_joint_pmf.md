# Joint PMF

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two discrete random variables with sample spaces $\S_X$ and $\S_Y$ respectively. 
The ***joint probability mass function (joint PMF)*** of $X$ and $Y$ is the function

$p_{X,Y}: \S_X \times \S_Y \to [0,1]$ defined as

$$
p_{X,Y}(x,y) = \P(X=x \land Y=y)
$$

where $\P$ is the probability function defined over the probability space $\pspace$.
